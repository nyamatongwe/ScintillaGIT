      </li>
      <li>
	ReplaceTarget replaced with two calls ReplaceTarget 
	(which is incompatible with previous ReplaceTarget) and 
	ReplaceTargetRE. Both of these calls have a count first 
	parameter which allows using strings containing nulls.

	the numeric keypad in conjunction with the Alt key.
      </li>
      <li>
	Document memory allocation changed to grow exponentially 
	which reduced time to load a 30 Megabyte file from

	Word part movement keys now handled in Scintilla rather than 
	SciTE.
      </li>
      <li>

	Bug fixed in HTML lexer handling % before &gt; as end ASP
	even when no start ASP encountered. 
        Bug fixed when scripts ended with a quoted string and 
        end tag was not seen.
      </li>
      <li>
	Bug fixed on Windows where context menu key caused menu to 
	appear in corner of screen rather than within window.
      </li>
      <li>
	Bug fixed in SciTE's Replace All command not processing
	whole file when replace string longer than search string.

        use the old APIs.
      </li>
      <li>
        "if" and "import" statements in SciTE properties files allows modularisation into
        language-specific properties files and choices based upon platform.
        This means that SciTE is delivered with 9 language-specific properties files
        as well as the standard SciTEGlobal.properties file.

        Auto-completion lists automatically size more sensibly.
      </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        Java and JavaScript lexers merged into C++ lexer.
      </li>
      <li>
        C++ lexer indicates unterminated strings by colouring the end of the line
	rather than changing the rest of the file to string style. This is less
	obtrusive and helps the folding.

      <li>
        Printing support in Scintilla on Windows.
      </li>
      <li>
        Styles can select colouring to end of line. This can be used when a file contains more than
        one language to differentiate between the areas in each language. An example is the HTML +
        JavaScript styling in SciTE.
      </li>
      <li>
        Actions can be grouped in the undo stack, so they will be undone together. This grouping is
        hierarchical so higher level actions such as replace all can be undone in one go. Call to
        discover whether there are any actions to redo.
      </li>
      <li>
        The set of characters that define words can be changed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Markers now have identifiers and can be found and deleted by their identifier. The empty
        marker type can be used to make a marker that is invisible and which is only used to trace
        where a particular line moves to.

        Additional tool commands can be added to SciTE.

        Windows version.
      </li>
      <li>
        SciTE can save a styled copy of the current file in HTML format. As SciTE does not yet

        HTML file.

        Released on 17 May 1999.
      </li>
      <li>
        Changed name of "Tide" to "SciTE" to avoid clash with a TCL based IDE. "SciTE" is a
        SCIntilla based Text Editor and is Latin meaning something like "understanding in a neat
        way" and is also an Old English version of the word "shit".
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a SCI_AUTOCSTOPS message for defining a string of characters that will stop

        Executing programs works much better now.
      </li>
      <li>
        New palette code to allow more colours to be displayed in 256 colour screen modes. A line
        number column can be displayed to the left of the selection margin.
      </li>
      <li>
        The code that maps from line numbers to text positions and back has been completely

        Released on 30th March 1999, containing bug fixes and a few more features.
      </li>
      <li>
        Static linking supported and Tidy.EXE, a statically linked version of Tide.EXE. Changes to
        compiler flags in the makefiles to optimise for size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scintilla supports a 'savepoint' in the undo stack which can be set by the container when
        the document is saved. Notifications are sent to the container when the savepoint is
        entered or left, allowing the container to to display a dirty indicator and change its
        menus.
      </li>
      <li>
        When Scintilla is set to read-only mode, a notification is sent to the container should the
        user try to edit the document. This can be used to check the document out of a version
        control system.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is an API for setting the appearance of indicators.
      </li>
      <li>
        The keyboard mapping can be redefined or removed so it can be implemented completely by the
        container. All of the keyboard commands are now commands which can be sent by the
        container.
      </li>
      <li>
        A home command like Visual C++ with one hit going to the start of the text on the line and
        the next going to the left margin is available. I do not personally like this but my
        fingers have become trained to it by much repetition.
      </li>
      <li>
        SCI_MARKERDELETEALL has an argument in wParam which is the number of the type marker to
        delete with -1 performing the old action of removing all marker types.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tide now understands both the file name and line numbers in error messages in most cases.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tide remembers the current lines of files in the recently used list.
