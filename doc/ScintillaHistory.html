      </li>
      <li>
	Bug fixed in Scintilla where ensuring a line was visible in the presence of folding
	operated on the document line instead of the visible line.
      </li>
      <li>
	SciTE command line processing modified to operate on arguments in order and in
	two phases. First any arguments before the first file name are processed, then the
	UI is opened, then the remaining arguments are processed. Actions defined for the

        The makefiles have changed. The makefile_vc and
	makefile_bor files in scintilla/win32 and scite/win32 have been
	merged into scintilla/win32/scintilla.mak and scite/win32/scite.mak.
	DEBUG may be defined for all make files and this will turn on
	assertions and for some make files will choose other debugging
	options.
      </li>
      <li>
         To make debugging easier and allow good use of BoundsChecker
	 there is a Visual C++ project file in scite/boundscheck that builds
	 all of Scintilla and SciTE into one executable.

       <a href="scite130.zip">Release 1.30</a>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Released on 26 July 2000.
      </li>
      <li>
        Much better support for PHP which is now an integral part of the HTML support.
      </li>
      <li>
        Start replacement of Windows-specific APIs with cross platform APIs.
        In 1.30, the new APIs are introduced but the old APIs are still available.
        For the GTK+ version, may have to include "WinDefs.h" explicitly to
        use the old APIs.
      </li>
      <li>
        "if" and "import" statements in SciTE properties files allows modularisation into
        language-specific properties files and choices based upon platform.
        This means that SciTE is delivered with 9 language-specific properties files
        as well as the standard SciTEGlobal.properties file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Much lower resource usage on Windows 9x.

        Option for printing magnified or miniaturised from screen settings.

      <li>
        Auto-completion lists automatically size more sensibly.
      </li>
      <li>
        SCI_CLEARDOCUMENTSTYLE zeroes all style bytes, ensures all
        lines are shown and deletes all folding information.
      </li>
      <li>
        On Windows, auto-completion lists are visually outdented rather than indented.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close all command in SciTE.
      </li>
      <li>
        On Windows multiple files can be dragged into SciTE.
      </li>
      <li>
        When saving a file, the SciTE option save.deletes.first deletes it before doing the save.
        This allows saving with a different capitalisation on Windows.

        When use tabs option is off pressing the tab key inserts spaces.
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        Scintilla provides SCI_CREATEDOCUMENT, SCI_ADDREFDOCUMENT, and

      <li>
        SciTE does not place window origin offscreen if no properties file found on GTK+.

      <li>
        Printing support in Scintilla on Windows.

      <li>
        Styles can select colouring to end of line. This can be used when a file contains more than
        one language to differentiate between the areas in each language. An example is the HTML +
        JavaScript styling in SciTE.
      </li>
      <li>
        Actions can be grouped in the undo stack, so they will be undone together. This grouping is
        hierarchical so higher level actions such as replace all can be undone in one go. Call to
        discover whether there are any actions to redo.
      </li>
      <li>
        The set of characters that define words can be changed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Markers now have identifiers and can be found and deleted by their identifier. The empty
        marker type can be used to make a marker that is invisible and which is only used to trace
        where a particular line moves to.

        Double click notification.
      </li>
      <li>

      <li>
        Additional tool commands can be added to SciTE.

        Entry fields in search dialogs remember last 10 user entries. Not working in all cases in
        Windows version.
      </li>
      <li>
        SciTE can save a styled copy of the current file in HTML format. As SciTE does not yet
        support printing, this can be used to print a file by then using a browser to print the
        HTML file.

        Released on 17 May 1999.
      </li>
      <li>
        Changed name of "Tide" to "SciTE" to avoid clash with a TCL based IDE. "SciTE" is a
        SCIntilla based Text Editor and is Latin meaning something like "understanding in a neat
        way" and is also an Old English version of the word "shit".
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a SCI_AUTOCSTOPS message for defining a string of characters that will stop
        autocompletion mode. Autocompletion mode is cancelled when any cursor movement occurs apart
        from backspace.

        GTK+ version now splits horizontally as well as vertically and all dialogs cancel when the

      <li>
        GTK+ version now contains all features of Windows version with some very small differences.
        Executing programs works much better now.
      </li>
      <li>
        New palette code to allow more colours to be displayed in 256 colour screen modes. A line
        number column can be displayed to the left of the selection margin.
      </li>
      <li>
        The code that maps from line numbers to text positions and back has been completely
        rewritten to be faster, and to allow markers to move with the text.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Released on 30th March 1999, containing bug fixes and a few more features.
      </li>
      <li>
        Static linking supported and Tidy.EXE, a statically linked version of Tide.EXE. Changes to
        compiler flags in the makefiles to optimise for size.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scintilla supports a 'savepoint' in the undo stack which can be set by the container when
        the document is saved. Notifications are sent to the container when the savepoint is
        entered or left, allowing the container to to display a dirty indicator and change its
        menues.
      </li>
      <li>
        When Scintilla is set to read-only mode, a notification is sent to the container should the
        user try to edit the document. This can be used to check the document out of a version
        control system.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is an API for setting the appearence of indicators.
      </li>
      <li>
        The keyboard mapping can be redefined or removed so it can be implemented completely by the
        container. All of the keyboard commands are now commands which can be sent by the
        container.
      </li>
      <li>
        A home command like Visual C++ with one hit going to the start of the text on the line and
        the next going to the left margin is available. I do not personally like this but my
        fingers have become trained to it by much repetition.
      </li>
      <li>
        SCI_MARKERDELETEALL has an argument in wParam which is the number of the type marker to
        delete with -1 performing the old action of removing all marker types.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tide now understands both the file name and line numbers in error messages in most cases.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tide remembers the current lines of files in the recently used list.
