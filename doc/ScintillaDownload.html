    <h2>
       Download.
    </h2>
    <p>
       The <a href="License.txt">license</a> for using Scintilla is similar to that of Python
      containing very few restrictions.
    </p>
    <h3>
       Release 1.22
    </h3>
    <h4>
       Windows
    </h4>
    <p>
       You can <a href="SciTE122.zip">download a ZIP file (410K)</a> containing the C++ source code
      and executables for Scintilla and SciTE. While a release version, it is likely that there are
      still bugs in the code that could lead to loss of data. Please make sure you save often and
      back up your source code.<br />
       After downloading the file, unzip it, and run SciTE.EXE. The files required to run SciTE are
      SciTE.EXE, Scintilla.DLL, and SciTEGlobal.properties and these are best located in one
      directory on the path.
    </p>
    <p>
       A <a href="Sc1.exe">single file executable called Sc1 (230K)</a> does not need any DLL or
      properties files as these are linked into the executable. You may still create properties
      files if you wish.
    </p>
    <h4>
       Linux and Linux compatible
    </h4>
    <p>
       There is a <a href="SciTE.tgz">GTK+/Linux</a> version (250K). In the Linux tradition, this
      download only contains source code and documentation and it is exactly the same source code
      as in the Windows version. To build it, you will have to have a c++ compiler (I use gcc
      2.95.2, but older gcc or egcs should do just as well) and GTK+ 1.2.x installed (tested on
      1.2.6).<br />
       The Makefile_gtk file is used to build SciTE, it can be invoked as:<br />
       make -f Makefile_gtk<br />
       The SciTEGTK.properties file is better than the SciTEGlobal.properties for use on Linux/GTK+
      as it specifies fonts that are likely to be installed. Under Linux, SciTE reads its
      SciTEGlobal.properties file from the user's home directory. The download file is available
      under the name <a href="SciTETGZ.zip"> SciTETGZ.zip</a> in case your browser does not want to
      download a .tgz file. Despite the .zip extension, this is still a tarred gzipped file.
